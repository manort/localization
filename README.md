#Localization

The exercise is in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kjPynvYsP8W4LBgTTWC-MN56FtSQbtje)

Steps to follow in order to view/execute the code with FIFA localization exercise. 

* Open a Chrome browser
* Sign in with a google account, and press "Open in playground" if you cannot execute it directly.
* Open the [link of the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kjPynvYsP8W4LBgTTWC-MN56FtSQbtj)
* In tab FILES, upload all the files in this repo 
* Run cell by cell. 

Please, read all the comments between cells and in cell headers since there is some code that is just to show the process I've followed but should not be executed again. 

The storytelling can be followed with comments in the notebook and also through a [Prezi presentation](https://prezi.com/view/nbunHbux979hQiKer3Zp/)
